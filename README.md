# Mastering Probability for Consistent Trading Success  
**A structured curriculum to transform trading from gambling to a systematic, probability-driven edge.**  

---

## **Overview**  
This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering probability-based trading. It combines theoretical frameworks, practical tools, and real-world examples (using Apple stock as a case study) to help traders build a consistent edge. The curriculum is inspired by the use of systematic disciplined approach and modern probabilistic thinking.  

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced trader, this repository will teach you how to:  
1. Estimate and track trade probabilities accurately.  
2. Build robust risk management systems.  
3. Develop and backtest probability-driven trading strategies.  
4. Avoid common biases and psychological pitfalls.

## **Repository Structure**  
The repository is organized into **6 modules**, each with lessons, exercises, and deliverables.  

### **1. Foundations of Probability in Trading**  
- Learn why trading is a probability game.  
- Understand core concepts like base rates, conditional probability, and Bayesian reasoning.  
- Identify and mitigate biases like overconfidence and anchoring.  

**Deliverable**: Probability journal with 20 entries.  

---

### **2. Probability Estimation & Calibration**  
- Assign explicit probabilities to trades using the "absurdity test."  
- Use Bayesian adjustments to refine estimates.  
- Calibrate your probability estimates through tracking and feedback.  

**Deliverable**: Calibrated probability spreadsheet.  

---

### **3. Risk Management & Expectancy Math**  
- Calculate trade expectancy using win rates and risk-reward ratios.  
- Use the Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing.  
- Hedge tail risks with options and scenario analysis.  

**Deliverable**: Risk management plan with position sizing rules.  

---

### **4. Advanced Probability Concepts**  
- Understand market regimes and conditional probability.  
- Plan for fat tails and black swan events.  
- Build multi-variable probability models.  

**Deliverable**: Backtest report for a trend pullback strategy.  

---

### **5. Probability-Driven Trading Strategies**  
- Develop and test strategies like trend pullbacks, mean reversion, and event-driven plays.  
- Use backtesting and Monte Carlo simulations to validate edges.  

**Deliverable**: Live trade experiment with 20 trades.  

---

### **6. Psychology & Continuous Improvement**  
- Focus on process over outcomes.  
- Build feedback loops for continuous improvement.  
- Adapt strategies to changing market regimes.  

**Deliverable**: Probability dashboard and final report.
